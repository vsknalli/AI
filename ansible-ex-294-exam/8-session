Tody we are goin going to lean very new architechture They have added AAP -Automation on the controler node.

Ansible Navigator
=================
We we have controler node where we have install ansible and target node
in controler node and managed node we need to install python sine , 
while we run the playbook the modules are copied from controller and its executed and quite 
	Since the ansible is written in python language we need python in both server
Ansible is agentless as well ....!!!

what is plugins in ansible ?
one of the name with the plugins in connections plugins
every plugin will something for you
ex:
time plugin
usr: per play how much time consuing 
mail plugin
use: if the play fails , need to send a mail about the status
cache plugins
callback plugins
Modules plugins 
lookup plugin........etc.etc...!!!

Plugins is kind of programe use control and module is a kind of programe use in managed node.

before you setup controller node or environment 4 
ansible interperator called module

Our requirement is suppose if we want to test our playbook on different different versoion os ansible like 2.2 2.4 2.3 like that --> In this situation i need to validate the palybook in different different version os ansible for doing test .
so if we want to create the environmenbt tacking long time in that situvation we can use 

ansible-navigator includes all the old commands like ansible-playbook ansible-config galaxu ansible-doc etc..etc....If you use the old command the playbook will run in own ansible control node only not in EE , if we use ansible-navigator it will create the EE and execute the 
playbook.

We need to install navigator which will create the EE for us That is called executin environment on the flay

## yum install ansible-navigator or dnf install ansible-navigator

Suppose if the software is not available in our repository we need to add the repository 

ansible is a python software we can use
# yum install pip3 -pip
# pip3 install ansible-navigator 

if you want to any python liberary we can use pip command to install the liberary
