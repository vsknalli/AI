Introduction:
=============
	While we are keeping our files in our localdisk there might be some possibilities the hard 
disk may correpted, we couldn't access our files in that senario to keep on having the the back on our files Git and GitHub plays a very big role.
	The back up would be not one time , we will keep on doing, since we are versioning the backup.
Since its normal text backup we would like to perform full-backup instead of incremendation with versioning concept.which helps to rollback very easily if anything goes wrong.

Importance of VCS
==================

The coure concept of git --> 

1) If you have certain data you have to keep the data in file (example file txt or programe)
2) Now you did some feature modification in your programe but its not working in this situvation we can 
roll-back to its previouse good version stage .

A	While it tacking back it will read file 1 take whatevet the difference it will take as a version-02 , i mean it will take incrementally, old data will be linked . This back is technically called "snapshots" 
	suppose the secound day we have deleted one line out of 5 line, in this situvation, git just update the information, in ths same day snapshot , just it marks the information by marker . (like 4th number is deleted) which is done by Marker. keepint the data area is called working area.
w	The next day what ever the change we are doing will be saved in special area which is called snapshot area, in Git it is called "Commit area".
